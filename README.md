### CALCULATOR


Major bugs known for functionality already implemented:

- ~~Pressing the "Del" button when primary display is
    a length of 1 will get rid of the div height for the
    primary display div.~~
    **Fixed 11/4/2016**
    
- ~~After a calculation has been made, CE has to be clicked
    to insert a new calculation. Add a conditional so that 
    if the "=" button is clicked, the next button click 
    automatically runs the CE function.~~ 
    **Fixed 11/4/2016**
    

Ideas for future potential functionality:

- Add additional buttons that perform additional functions
    or give additional values. e.g pi, squareroot, exponents,
    factorials.
- Add the ability to use the keyboard numberpad for input.
  
  
### FACTORS

  
No bugs currently known.
  
Ideas for future potential functionality:

- Calculate the greatest common factor of all integers
    in the array.
    

### BASE CONVERSION


Currently in implementation as of 13/4/16.

Ideas for future potential functionality:

- Allow conversion of real numbers up to 10 digits from radix


### FUTURE WIDGETS


Future widgets to be implemented include:

- A trigonometric calculator.
- ~~Conversion between number bases- i.e. decimal, octal,
    hexadecimal and binary with fractional component.~~
    **Implemented 12/4/16 - currently in implementation**
- Add a "Notebook" div similar to a paintboard to 
    squiggle on, draft etc.
- A graphing tool for functions.
- GoogleAds styled to match the webapp.
