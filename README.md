# SIMPLE JAVASCRIPT CALCULATOR

BUGS
----

Bugs known for functionality already implemented:

    - Pressing the "Del" button when primary display is
    a length of 1 will get rid of the div height for the
    primary display div.
    - After a calculation has been made, CE has to be clicked to insert a new calculation. Add a conditional so that if the "=" button is clicked, the next button click automatically runs the CE function.
    
    
FUTURE POTENTIAL FUNCTIONALITY
------------------------------

Ideas for future potential functionality:

    - Add additional buttons that perform additional functions or give additional values. e.g pi, squareroot, exponents, trigonometric functions etc.
    - Add the ability to use the keyboard numberpad for input.
    - Maybe provide user options on the side of the calculator to provide custom formatting e.g. change colours, fonts etc.
    - If the files get too large, formal commenting in javadoc should be implemented.
