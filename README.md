# javascriptCalculator
Bugs known for functionality already implemented:
    - Pressing the "Del" button when primary display is
    a length of 1 will get rid of the div height for the
    primary display div.
    - After a calculation has been made, CE has to be clicked
    to insert a new calculation. Add a conditional so that if
    the "=" button is clicked, the next button click automatically runs the CE         
    function.
